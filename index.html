<p>I have spent 5 years in education. The first 3 years of my teaching career where spent teaching 4th grade in Florida. I then moved back home to Lebanon PA. I taught in 5th grade in a public school for one year, then transition to a non-public school. Prior to working in education I spent years volunteering and working for various ministies in roles mainly focused on working with children and youth. My classroom is a place where students are presented with hands on learning opportunities in a colabrative community.</p>
