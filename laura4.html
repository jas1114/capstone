<h1>My Philosophy on Education</h1>

<p>     My philosophy of student discipline is based on the responsibilities and expectations I have for myself as an educator and the expectations I have for my students. "Student discipline" encompasses more than negative consequences for poor behavior. The term includes all student behavior and conduct.</p>
<p>     I believe that it is my job, as a classroom teacher, to start the school year by creating a classroom environment with clear expectations, structure, and consequences. This starts by first understanding and utilizing any school-based system already in place. This knowledge will assist me to establish a classroom management system which aligns with the school-wide system. My experience as a Therapeutic Staff Support, TSS, has taught me that sustaining these clear and consistent policies as the year progresses will be a challenge at times. My maintaining these practices, however, is key to upholding the expectations for students and ensuring a safe, secure, and nurturing environment.</p>
<p>The first step toward developing my classroom procedural system is knowing the students. During the first few days of school, I engage my students in “get to know you” games and activities, which  build rapport and allow me to learn basic facts about them. Knowing a student’s favorite character, color, and flavor of ice cream is fun, however it will not help stimulate a student to his or her highest potential. Additionally interactions through whole group and small group instruction allow me to monitor a student’s progress toward mastering a learning goal. Both activities and interactions allow me to create a unique connection and relationship with each student to become not only a teacher but also a mentor. My role as a mentor then enables me to reach a student’s character. The student and I are then able to work together to explore who that student wants to be and what behaviors are needed for that goal to be accomplished. </p>
<p>    One of my foundational beliefs regarding student behavior and conduct is to help a student develop self -monitoring behavior and awareness. Some students will be able to develop these behaviors within the   structure of a school based behavior system. Other students may require more visual and verbal cues to advance these skills. I have had many opportunities to work with students in a variety of settings, where additional strategies were needed to support students to develop these more independent self-monitoring skills. </p>
<p>In addition to school-based systems, I think it is just as important for a teacher to understand the community and culture of the students. Communication with parents, understanding and developing a relationship with a student are critical aspects of creating a positive learning environment. Each community has expectations, and these expectations influence the student’s consequences within the classroom. Consequences, whether positive or negative, must be significant to the student and appropriate to the situation. There is not a one size fits all answer. Until a teacher looks at the contextual factors of the district and school this area is very grey. As populations change systems  may also need to change. It has been said that it takes a village to raise a child, all stakeholders must be involved in the learning community.</p>
<p>    My Philosophy of Student Discipline is comparable to a living document. It is constantly changing based on the factors of the students and school. At the foundation, positive and negative consequences should be used for all students. I believe in consequences that are appropriate for the behaviors and  are also significant to the student. As a teacher I have several strategies I employ for behavior management. These may not work for all students and I need to change to find what will work to manage a learning environment. My ultimate goal is to create a positive learning environment that promotes self-monitoring behaviors for life- long learners.</p>
